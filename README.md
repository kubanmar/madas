# similarity-data-framework

A framework to compare different similarity measures of materials. <br>
Features: <br>
  * Automatic download of materials from the NOMAD Encyclopedia
  * ASE Database to locally store materials data
  * Fingerprints:
    * DOS --> Calculated from DFT DOS values
    * Symmetry --> All symmetry operations of a material

Finally, similarities of materials can be calculated:
  * DOS: Overlap of DOS 
  * Symmetry: Number of shared symmetry operations
